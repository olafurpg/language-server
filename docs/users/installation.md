## VS Code

Metals is not yet published on the extension marketplace. For now, it is
necessary to install the Metals extension as a `*.vsix` file from
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/scalameta/metals/releases). It is
recommended to watch the [scalameta/metals](https://github.com/scalameta/metals)
repo to receive notifications about new releases.
